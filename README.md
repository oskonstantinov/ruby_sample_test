# Sample functional test with PageObject, Capybara+RSpec and API test with Airborne+RSpec

<<<<<<< HEAD
A sample project using FF browser and show test steps on Wikipedia open-source website. API test show on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. Also I add universal drag'n'drop method based on https://gist.github.com/rcorreia/2362544. I don't use them in this sample test, but this configuration works on my other projects and don't need adaptation to your code. 

Works only at Ruby v5 (because airborne gem).
