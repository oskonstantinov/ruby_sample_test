# RSpec-Capybara sample test with PageObject

A sample project using FF browser and show test steps on Wikipedia open-source website. Also I add universal drag'n'drop method based on https://gist.github.com/rcorreia/2362544. I don't use them in this sample test, but this configuration works on my other projects and don't need adaptation to your code. 

**Setup**

`git clone https://github.com/oskonstantinov/ruby_sample_test.git`

`cd ruby_sample_test`

`bundle install`

**Execute Specs**

`rspec spec/tests/sample_test_spec.rb`
